## Nothing Fancy

No scripts or stylesheets enqueued. No settings or admin pages. Just some basic infrustructure to be renamed then developed further.

## Compatibility

* This plugin was written in a WordPress 5.0+ environment and a ClassicPress 1.0.1 environment.
* This plugin was written on a local server running PHP 7.3
* The short array syntax ( `[]` rather than `array()` ) requires PHP 5.4+
* Run a modern setup and you'll be fine.

The plugin contains several compatibility functions. These check for WordPress 5.0 or higher (with the block editor), check if the site runs ClassicPress rather than WordPress, and acouple of checks for Advanced Custom Fields.
